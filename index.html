                <h3>Tsavo National Park</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Named after the <strong>Tsavo River</strong> which runs west to east through the park, Tsavo is located in the south-east of Kenya near the border with Tanzania and relatively close to the Kenyan coastal resorts. It is split into Tsavo West and Tsavo East by the main Mombasa to Nairobi highway. &nbsp;The slightly larger <strong>Tsavo East</strong> is predominantly flat with dry plains, while Tsavo West is more mountainous and wetter than its counterpart. Tsavo East is huge. &nbsp;Nine times bigger than the Masai Mara. &nbsp;It is famous for its large herds of dust-red elephants, cheetah and short-maned Tsavo lions. &nbsp;Wildlife densities, however, are lower than in other areas of the country, so perhaps isn't a place to simply tick off the Big 5. <strong>Tsavo West</strong> is dotted with volcanic hills, some of which are only 200 years old, and the topography of the park is in stark contrast to Tsavo East. &nbsp;This hilly, wooded landscape can make game viewing a little tricky on occasion, but the wildlife is there is large numbers; particularly elephants and lion. &nbsp;There is also a black rhino sanctuary and the birdlife is outstanding.

                <h3>Tsavo East National Park</h3>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> is by far the biggest of Kenya&rsquo;s parks. At more than 13,700km&sup2;, <strong>Tsavo East</strong> is nine times bigger than the <strong>Masai Mara National Reserve</strong>: indeed, you could fit the whole of the Mara reserve into the southern tip of <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong>, south of the Voi River. Tsavo East has another big draw: you can set off on a game drive across the seemingly empty wilderness and return to camp three hours later without having seen a single other vehicle. There are very few camps and lodges here and, relatively speaking, almost none, with the majority of them close to Voi in the west, near the Mombasa highway. You often have the park to yourself, watching the wildlife under a huge sky: no matter what you&rsquo;re looking at, Tsavo East always feels like a big spectacle. When considering a <strong>Tsavo East safari</strong>, it's worth knowing that nearly all <strong>safaris to Tsavo East</strong> take place in the south of the Tsavo park, south of the Galana River. The enormous northern region of Tsavo East was closed to the public for many years and, although it is now open again, distances are vast up here and there is virtually no infrastructure. Incidentally, although Tsavo East and Tsavo West share a name &ndash; and a common border, coinciding with the Mombasa highway &ndash; they are two distinct national parks with different eco-systems: the wooded and hilly landscapes, dotted with volcanic cones and dramatic, black lava flows of Tsavo West National Park and the much flatter, more open plains and scattered bush that characterize Tsavo East National Park. Unlock the mysteries of <strong>Tsavo East Safaris</strong> on this thrilling night game drive package! With its plentiful wildlife, it&rsquo;s no wonder why Tsavo East is one of the most beloved safari destinations. Enjoy the adventure of a lifetime as you explore this mysterious wilderness under the stars &ndash; from tracking predators to witnessing explosive chases and kills! This experience can&rsquo;t be missed &ndash; just make sure to reserve your <strong>safaris to Tsavo East</strong> with Night Game Drive in advance.
